# Planning Prompts

1. **RECURSION**
*When the steps say “Use Recursion to…”, 
describe exactly what it is telling you to do*

*FIXME*

2. **PARAMETERS** 
*Give some serious thought to what parameters need to be utilized by 
your recursive function. You will basically need to know:*
- where to start to draw the rectangle,
- how wide it should be, 
- how tall it should be, and 
- what color it should be. 
*Using all of this, information, describe the parameters you plan to use.*

*FIXME*

3. **BASE CASE** 
*Given the above series of steps uses the recursive method, 
what is the base case? Explain.*

*FIXME*

4. **RANDOM NUMBER**
*Explain how the recursion minimum and recursion maximum 
just discussed relate to the base case for your recursion.*

*FIXME*

5. **RANDOM NUMBER COMPUTATION**
*Assuming you know the coordinate of your upper left corner and 
the width of your original rectangle. 
Given that the random number generator that I gave you generates a 
random number between 1 and a random max, 
how will you generate an appropriately sized random number and 
how will you use it for your next function call?*

*FIXME*

6. **WHITEBOARD DESIGN**
*Write a high level design plan for your program.
You can use screenshots of your work on an actual white board 
or you can use pseudocode.*

*FIXME*

# Implementation and Customization Prompts

7. **SPLITTING**
*How many “units” wide or tall did you consider a 
rectangle too small to split?*

*FIXME*

8. **NUMBER CALLS**
*While filling out the above rectangle in the Mondrian’s style 
using the series of steps above, 
is there anything you noticed that will change how many times the 
recursive function gets called?*

*FIXME*

9. **EXTRA STEPS**
*Most design choices have advantages as well as disadvantages. 
Given the above series of steps, 
are there any steps you felt were unnecessary given what other steps perform?*

*FIXME*

10. **DISADVANTAGE**
*Describe and explain at least one disadvantage of using recursion to 
generate Mondrian art.*

*FIXME*

11. **REQUIRED CUSTOMIZATIONS**
*What customizations did you make Mondrian art, and why did you choose it.*

*FIXME*

12. **PROCESS SUMMARY**
*Briefly summarize your design and implementation process, 
including how much your initial design plan evolved, 
the final results you achieved, and the amount of time you spent 
as a programmer or programmers in accomplishing these results. 
This should be one or at most two paragraphs.*

*FIXME*

13. **DESIGN CHALLENGES**
*Describe the primary conceptual challenges that you encountered 
in trying to complete this lab and what might have made the 
lab easier for you.*

*FIXME*

14. **BIG O ANALYSIS**
*Please analyze the Big O of all of the methods of the MondrianArt class, 
including constructors. 
Hint: Given the random nature of this lab, 
be sure you write about the worst case.*

*FIXME*

15. **TESTING**
*Please briefly describe your testing process. 
Here you should be careful to select representative input cases, 
including both representative typical cases as well as extreme cases.*

*FIXME*

16. **ERRORS**
*List in bulleted form of all known errors 
and deficiencies with a very brief explanation.*

- *FIXME*
- *FIXME*

17. **LEARNING AND REACTION**
*A paragraph or so of your own comments 
on what you learned and your reactions to this lab.*

*FIXME*

18. **INTEGRITY STATEMENT**
*Please briefly describe ALL help you received and 
all help you gave to others in completing this lab.
Also list all other references below.* 
**If you worked in a pair you must also attested to only 
having worked together as a pair, not separately.**
